# Software Renderer

This project is a software renderer, designed to demonstrate graphics rendering techniques and algorithms using only CPU-based computation. It is intended for educational purposes, experimentation, and as a foundation for more advanced rendering projects.

## Features

- Pure software rendering (no GPU acceleration)
- Modular codebase for easy experimentation
- Uses [SDL](https://github.com/libsdl-org/SDL) for window management and input (as a submodule)

## Getting Started

### Cloning the Repository

This project uses Git submodules. To clone the repository and initialize the SDL submodule, run:

```bash
git clone --recursive https://github.com/satiniize/software-renderer.git
```

If you already cloned the repository without `--recursive`, initialize the submodule with:

```bash
git submodule update --init --recursive
```

### Building

(Provide build instructions here, e.g., using CMake or Make, once available.)

### Running

(Provide instructions for running the renderer once built.)
